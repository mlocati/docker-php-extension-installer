        Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report!
        Please remark that this project is about the `install-php-extensions` command, not about `docker-php-ext-install`.
        File this bug report for the [supported PHP extensions](https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer#supported-php-extensions).
        If you'd like support for a new extension please submit a [feature request](https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) instead.

        Please specify the version of `install-php-extensions version`.
        You can see the version in the first line after executing the command. For example:
        ```sh
        $ install-php-extensions zip
        install-php-extensions v.1.4.15
        ...
        ```
        If it's not the [latest one](https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer/releases/latest) please update it: we don't support old versions.

        Please provide the relevant parts of your Dockerfile to reproduce the issue.
        Please don't post your whole Dockerfile: it'll take more time from the maintainers to check what's going wrong.
        And it's time you won't pay for.

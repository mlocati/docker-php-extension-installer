# Informations for the repository maintainers

## Publish a new version

The creation of a new version is done automatically by the [`readme-release.yml`](https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer/blob/master/.github/workflows/readme-release.yml) GitHub Action.

Whenever a push to the GitHub repository changes the [`install-php-extensions`](https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer/blob/master/install-php-extensions) script,
that Action creates a new tag, incrementing the patch level (for example, if the previous version was `1.2.3`, it creates the tag `1.2.4`).
Before doing that, the Action waits for 30 seconds, so that maintainers can cancel the tag creation if they want to create a different tag (for example, `1.3.3`).

Once this new tag is created automatically (or when maintainers push a new version-like tag to the repository), the Action creates a new draft release, attaching it the `install-php-extensions` script to it
(so that users can download it via the `https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer/releases/latest/download/install-php-extensions` URL.

Once that draft release has been created, you have to:

1. go to the [releases page](https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer/releases)
2. edit the newly created draft release
3. review the release notes
4. publish the release
